     * why b will eventually become zero:
     * Suppose in the first iteration a&b = 1011 0101 , pay attention to all the zero bits.
     * (1) the operation a&b << 1 will introduce an 0-bit and has the ability to reduce a head 1-bit.
     * For example 1011 0101
     *          => 0110 1010,
     * the first 1-bit is removed and a brand new 0-bit is introduced at the end.
     * Thus, after assign a&b<<1 to b, b has less 1-bit and more 0-bit than a&b .
     *
     * (2) Continue iterating, the operation a & b preserves all the 0-bit in b no matter what aÂ· is, as 0&(.) = 0.
     *
     * Thus, combining (1) and (2), b will hold less and less 1-bit during the iteration, and eventually become zero.
