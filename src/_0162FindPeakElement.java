     * Let D stands for the derivative, we know that D(-1)>0, D(n-1)<0 (nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž)
     * If D(mid-1) < 0, there must be a value x between [low, mid-1] for that from left to right of it ,
     * D>0 becomes D<0.
     *
     * Another perspective:
     * Lets say you have a mid number at index x, nums[x]
     * if (num[x+1] > nums[x]), that means a peak element HAS to exist on the right half of that array,
     * because every number is unique ->
     * 1) the numbers keep increasing on the right side, and the peak will be the last element.
     * 2) the numbers stop increasing at nums[y-1] > nums[y], nums[y-1] is a peak element.
     *
     * This same logic can be applied to the left hand side (nums[x] < nums[x-1]).
     *
     * ----

     * Assume we initialize left = 0, right = nums.length - 1. The invariant I'm using is the following:
     * nums[left - 1] < nums[left] && nums[right] > nums[right + 1]
     *
     * Time: O(log n)
     * Space: O(1)
