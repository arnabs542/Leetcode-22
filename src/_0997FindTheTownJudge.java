     * 1. Two Array - Indegree and outdegree
     *
     * Time:
     * loop over trust: O(E)
     * loop over people: O(N)
     * because we terminate early if E < N -  1
     * the worst case: E >= N - 1
     * -> O(E)
     *
     * Space: O(N)
     *
     * This last note is provided more for interest than for interview preparation.
     * A variant of the approach is to use a HashMaps.
     * That way, you'll only need to store in-degrees and out-degrees that are non-zero.
     * This will have no impact on the time complexity, because we still need to look at the entire input Array.
     * It also has no impact on the worst case space complexity, because when a town judge exists,
     * all the other N - 1 people have an out-degree of at least 1 (from their trust of the town judge).
     *
     * In some cases where E â‰¥ N - 1 but there is no town judge, some memory might be saved,
     * with a best case of O(\sqrt{E}\,)
     * This represents the situation of the number of unique people present in the trust Array being minimized
     * (beyond an easy-level question interview, don't panic!).
     * With the overhead of a HashMap, there's probably no gain of using one over an Array for this problem.
