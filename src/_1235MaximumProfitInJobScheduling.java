/**
 * Before thinking about this weighted Interval Scheduling problem,
 * let's take a look at Unweighted Interval Scheduling, which is problem 646. Maximum Length of Pair Chain.
 *
 * For Unweighted Interval Scheduling, we can easily use greedy algorithm.
 * (Greedy template: consider some natural order: earliest start time, earliest finish time,
 * shortest interval, or fewest conflicts, and think about counterexamples)
 * First sort by finish time(ascending order) then decide whether to fit the next interval in or not based on its start time.
 * See the prove here
 * http://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs482/2007su/ahead.pdf.
 * https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~wayne/kleinberg-tardos/pearson/04GreedyAlgorithms-2x2.pdf
 *
 * But Greedy algorithm can fail spectacularly if arbitrary weights are allowed.
 * So that's when DP comes in.
 * https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse521/13wi/slides/06dp-sched.pdf
 * From my understanding, greedy is a specific kind of DP, and DP is a general greedy.
 * (greedy is local optimization, dp is global optimization)
 *
 * For this problem we can still first sort by finish time(ascending order)
 * then use DP to decide whether it is profitable to put in the next interval based on its value.
 * Here is the essence:
 *
 * Define Job j starts at sj, finishes at fj, and has weight or value vj, and p(j) = largest index i < j such that job i is compatible with j.
 * Then it should be like:
 * DP[j] = max(vj + DP[p(j)], DP[j-1])
 *
 * For optimizing we can use binary search to locate p(j).
