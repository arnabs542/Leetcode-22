     * Lexicographical order:
     * comparison between the first unequal corresponding character
     *
     * The leftmost letter will be
     * 1) [smallest] letter
     * 2) such that [the suffix from that letter contains every other]
     *
     * If there are multiple smallest letters, then we pick the leftmost one simply because it gives us more options.
     * We can always eliminate more letters later on, so the optimal solution will always remain in our search space.
     *
     * "cbacdcbc"
     * a: 1 -> 0, b: 2 -> 1, c: 4 -> 3, d: 1
     *
     * "cdcbc" pos = 0
     * b: 1, c: 2 d: 1 -> 0
     *
     * "db"
     * b: 1, d: 1 -> 0

     * "b"
     * b: 1 -> 0

     * Time complexity: O(n)
     * Space complexity: O(n)
     * Each time we slice the string we're creating a new one (strings are immutable).
     * The number of slices is bound by a constant, so we have O(N) * C = O(N)O(N)âˆ—C=O(N).

     * 2. Greedy with Stack
     *
     * As we iterate over our string,
     * 1) if character i is greater than character i+1
     * 2) another occurrence of character i exists later in the string,
     * deleting character i will always lead to the optimal solution.
     * Characters that come later in the string i don't matter in this calculation because i is in a more significant spot.
     * Even if character i+1 isn't the best yet, we can always replace it for a smaller character down the line if possible.
     *
     * Since we try to remove characters as early as possible,
     * and picking the best letter at each step leads to the best solution,
     * "greedy" should be going off like an alarm.
     *
     *
     * StringBuilder:
     * if you know the approximate size of the string you are dealing with then
     * you can tell StringBuilder how much size to allocate upfront
     * otherwise it will, if it runs out of space, have to double the size by creating a new char[] array then copy data over
     * You can cheat by giving the size and then there is no need for this array creation
     *
     * The StringBuffer class is a subclass of AbstractStringBuilder, which defines a char[] to hold the characters.
     * It uses System.arraycopy to move the existing characters out of the way on a call to insert.
     * so insert() is O(n)
     *
     * StringBuilder vs String concatenation:
     * The key is whether you are writing a single concatenation all in one place or accumulating it over time.
     * For cases like "a" + "b", there's no point in explicitly using StringBuilder.
     * But if you are building a string e.g. inside a loop, use StringBuilder.
     *
     * Time complexity : O(N).
     * Although there is a loop inside a loop, the time complexity is still O(N).
     * This is because the inner while loop is bounded by the total number of elements added to the stack (each time it fires an element goes).
     * This means that the total amount of time spent in the inner loop is bounded by O(N), giving us a total time complexity of O(N).
     *
     * Space complexity : O(1).
     * At first glance it looks like this is O(N), but that is not true!
     * seen will only contain unique elements, so it's bounded by the number of characters in the alphabet (a constant).
     * You can only add to stack if an element has not been seen, so stack also only consists of unique elements.
     * This means that both stack and seen are bounded by constant, giving us O(1) space complexity.
