     * knows(a, b):
     * 1) if a knows b, then a can't be a cele
     * 2) if a doesn't know b, then b can't be a cele
     * -> either way, we can eliminate one person
     *
     * First Loop: Find the candidate k.
     * Suppose the candidate after the first for loop is person k,
     * 1ï¼‰0 to k-1 cannot be the celebrity, otherwise it will not pass the candidate position to k
     * 2) k knows no one in (k+1, n-1), k+1 to n-1 can not be the celebrity either.
     * Therefore, k is the only possible celebrity, if there exists one.
     *
     * Second loop: Check if k indeed does not know any other persons and all other persons know k.
     * in 1st pass, we've already known candidate do not know the people after him.
     * in 2nd pass,
     * 1) before candidate, we check them whether know each other,
     * 2) after candidate, only check whether people know candidate will be ok, which will save n/2 ask for average.
